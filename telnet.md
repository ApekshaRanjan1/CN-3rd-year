## Key Points

- **Shell Definition**: A shell is software that provides a user interface to the operating system, allowing users to enter commands.

- **Remote Access**: Remote access to the shell can be achieved using programs like **telnet** and **ssh**. The remote computer runs server software (telnet/ssh), while the local computer runs client software.

- **Client-Server Interaction**: Users interact with client software on their local computer, which sends requests to the server on the remote computer. Many multiuser computers run server programs for user connections.

- **Client Software Examples**: Examples of client software include email clients (e.g., Outlook Express, Mozilla Thunderbird) and web browsers, which interact with email and web servers respectively.

- **Terminal Emulation**: Shell access clients provide a terminal window, mimicking the functionality of old monitors used in terminals.

- **Low-Bandwidth Connection**: SSH and telnet provide a simple, low-bandwidth connection method, requiring minimal information transfer per second. They can operate without a fast connection and from any network-connected computer, regardless of the operating system or GUI used.

- **Telnet Protocol**: **Telnet** is a protocol for connecting to remote computers over a TCP/IP network (e.g., the internet). After establishing a connection with a telnet server, the client acts as a virtual terminal for communication. Users typically need an account to log in to the remote host, although guest access may be available in some cases.


## Steps to Install and Use Telnet in Ubuntu

**Step 1**: Open the Terminal window by pressing `Ctrl + Alt + T`. You will see a prompt with `$`, indicating that you are not logged in as a root user. To install Telnet, type the following command and press enter:
```bash
sudo apt-get install telnetd
```


If you are logged in as a root user, you do not need to use `sudo`. The `telnetd` is a daemon invoked by `inetd` or its extension `xinetd`, both of which are internet servers.

---

**Step 2**: You will be prompted to enter your user password. After entering your password and pressing enter, processing will begin. You may see a message indicating that an additional disk space of "274 KB will be used." 

A prompt will appear asking you to confirm the installation. Type `y` and press enter to continue.

---

**Step 3**: After the installation is complete, restart `inetd` by typing the following command:
```bash
sudo /etc/init.d/open-bsd-inetd restart
```


The `inetd` daemon handles incoming network requests and determines which program to run when a request is received.

---

**Step 4**: To ensure `inetd` has started, press enter after typing the above command.

---

**Connecting to a Remote Client**:

**Step 5**: To connect to a remote client, type:

```bash
telnet <host_ip_address>
```

For example:
`telnet 122.175.140.221`


Then press enter.

---

**Step 6**: You will see a message indicating that you are connected to the host IP address. For security reasons, you will need to provide a username and password.
